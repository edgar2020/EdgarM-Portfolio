        <p class="AboutParagraph">Hello, I'm Edgar! I am a highschool graduate who decided 
        that it was finaly time to test my knowledge on various 
        programing subjects, such as digital art, HTML/CSS/JS, java 
        etc. I have been "coding" since the seventh grade where I 
        began with making basic html and css websites. Then that 
        evolved into learning Java, then into doing digital art and 
        so forth. The difference was that it was almost always for 
        school. It is not until recently that I have decided that I 
        want to grow my skillset on my own. Hence why I decided to 
        start this poject and the various others that I plan to 
        eventualy link onto this very same website. I hope that as I 
        modify and expand this website that I can learn more about
        various techniques and skillsets that are neccessary in real
        industry, and that those who happen accross this website reach
        out to me and offer constructive criticisms.
